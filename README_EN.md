## English

This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction data with the goal of identifying patterns that influence the customer experience and predicting their satisfaction level using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

### 📌 Objective

The main purposes are:

- Explore and clean data related to passenger satisfaction.
- Analyze key metrics affecting the customer experience.
- Train classification models to predict whether a passenger will be satisfied or dissatisfied.

### 📂 Project Contents

- Data exploration and cleaning: Detect missing values and outliers.
- Exploratory analysis: Visualize distributions and correlations.
- Predictive modeling: Train models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
- Model evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python: Primary analysis language.
- Pandas: Data manipulation.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: Modeling and evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development.

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains information about:

- Passenger demographics.
- Flight features (duration, class, trip type, etc.).
- Feedback on various airline services (food, comfort, entertainment, etc.).
- Passenger-reported satisfaction level.
